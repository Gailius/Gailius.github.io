 WHY NOT WORKING?

I am a **Development Economist** and **Field Coordinator** working at the World Bank Bureaucracy Lab. My mission is to reduce poverty and inequality in Eastern Europe and around the World. My main topics of interest in Economics include Development, Education, Health and Political Economy. All my public analysis and programming work is designed to be reproducible through GitHub, but all current projects are still in progress.

This website makes use of Open Source resources. Most notably, it is based on and heavily borrows from the Jekyll theme "Minimal Mistakes" as created by Michael Rose. I sincerely thank Michael for his excellent work in making beautiful website design accessible for non-developers.
