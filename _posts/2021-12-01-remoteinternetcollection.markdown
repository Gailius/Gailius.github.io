Traditional modes of remote data collection, including web and telephone based surveys, often require compromises in survey length and question type. In order to go around these issues, in our most recent project, we piloted remote data collection by video conference. This format is closer in spirit to traditional face-to-face surveys, but requires additional considerations in terms of project set-up. My colleague Patricia and are writing a post on lessons learned along the way. The post is to be published. It will be added to this page when it is ready.
